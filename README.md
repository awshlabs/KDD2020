# KDD2020 Put Deep Learning to work: Accelerate Deep Learning through AWS EC2 and ML Services  (Tentatively 8/25 at 9AM PDT)
# Abstract
Deploying deep learning (DL) projects are becoming increasingly more pervasive at enterprises and startups alike. At Amazon, Machine Learning University (MLU)-trained engineers are taking DL to every aspect of Amazonâ€™s businesses, beyond just Amazon Go, Alexa, and Robotics.
In this workshop, Wenming Ye (AWS), Rachel Hu (AWS), and Miro Enev(Nvidia) offer a practical next step in DL learning with instructions, and hands-on labs using the latest Nvidia GPUs and AWS Inferentia. You will explore the current trends powering AI/DL adoption, powerful new GPU/AWS Inferentia accelerator instances, distributed training and inference optimization in neural networks.

Wenming Ye  (AWS),
Rachel Hu   (AWS),
Miro Enev   (Nvidia).

Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. Amazon EC2 P3 instances deliver the highest performance compute in the cloud, are cost-effective, support all major machine learning frameworks, and are available globally. In this workshop, you'll create a SageMaker notebook instance and work through sample Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate some of the many features of SageMaker and how Amazon EC2 P3 is used to accelerate machine learning model training.
